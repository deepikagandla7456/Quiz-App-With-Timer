The Quiz App with Timer is a simple web app that helps you test your programming or math knowledge. Just choose a category, select the number of questions, and answer them before the timer runs out!

## About
This quiz app is built with *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*.
You can select a category (Programming or Mathematics), choose how many questions you want to attempt, and start the quiz.
After you're done, you’ll see how many questions you got right!

## Limitations & Future Work

- Right now, the questions are static and written inside the script.
- Only two categories are available.
- The past quiz results aren’t saved.

### Future Work

- Dynamically load questions from JSON or an API.
- Add more categories and adjustable timer settings.
- Store scores locally or on a backend.
- Implement additional features like difficulty levels and a leaderboard.
