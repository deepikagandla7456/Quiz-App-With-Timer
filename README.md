## About

**Quiz App with Timer** is a lightweight quiz application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Users select a category (Programming or Mathematics), choose the number of questions, and then take a timed quiz. Once completed, a final message shows that, for example, “9 out of 10 questions are correct” along with an option to try again.

---

## Limitations & Future Work

- Questions are static and written inside the script.
- Limited to two categories.
- No data persistence for past attempts.

### Future Work

- Dynamically load questions from JSON or an API.
- Add more categories and adjustable timer settings.
- Store scores locally or on a backend.
- Implement additional features like difficulty levels and a leaderboard.

- Choose the number of questions: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
